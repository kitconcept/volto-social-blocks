## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 18 and later

Add `@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks": "*"
}
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = '@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks';
```

### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @kitconcept/volto-social-blocks
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-social-blocks": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Test it

Go to http://localhost:3000/, login, create a new page. The social blocks will show up in the Volto blocks chooser.

### Custom Privacy Consent Notice

You can register a custom React component to check for privacy consent and show the user a prompt to confirm accessing the external services. This is useful to meet European GDPR requirements, for example.

```
config.registerComponent({
  name: 'CheckPrivacyConsent',
  component: IfConfirm,  # use your own component here
});
```

The [@kitconcept/volto-dsgvo-banner](https://github.com/kitconcept/volto-dsgvo-banner) addon provides one possible implementation of the `CheckPrivacyConsent` component.

## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).
